# check-safety.sh — PreToolUse hook: runtime guardrails for dangerous operations
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (for GitHub readers):
# Claude Code Harness (github.com/Chachamaru127/claude-code-harness) enforces 13 safety
# rules (R01-R13) via TypeScript. This is a lightweight shell equivalent that catches
# the most critical risks without requiring Node.js.
#
# Inspired by: Anthropic harness engineering research
# https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/harness-design-long-running-apps
#
# HOW IT WORKS:
# This script runs BEFORE every Bash command Claude executes.
# If it detects a dangerous pattern, it forces Claude to ASK the user for permission
# instead of running silently. Safe commands pass through without interruption.
#
# RULES:
# S01: Block sudo commands (privilege escalation)
# S02: Block .env file commits (secret exposure)
# S03: Block force push (history destruction)
# S04: Block hard reset to main (work destruction)
# S05: Block --no-verify (hook bypass)
# S06: Block direct push to main/master (process bypass)
# S07: Block credential file writes (secret exposure)
# S08: Block rm -rf on project root or home (catastrophic deletion)
