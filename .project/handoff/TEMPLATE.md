# Phase Handoff: {{FROM_PHASE}} → {{TO_PHASE}}

> **Purpose**: This document preserves context across phase transitions.
> AI agents lose memory between long sessions. This file ensures the next phase
> starts with full knowledge of what happened, what was decided, and what remains.
>
> Reference: Anthropic's harness research shows context degradation in long-running
> tasks. Structured handoff documents are the mitigation.
